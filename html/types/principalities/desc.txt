The "Principalities" (Latin: principatus), also translated as "Princedoms" and "Rulers", from the Greek archai, pl. of archÄ“ (see Greek root in Eph 3:10), are the angels that guide and protect nations, or groups of peoples, and institutions such as the Church. The Principalities preside over the bands of angels and charge them with fulfilling the divine ministry. There are some who administer and some who assist.[14]

The Principalities are shown wearing a crown and carrying a sceptre. Their duty also is said to be to carry out the orders given to them by the upper sphere angels and bequeath blessings to the material world. Their task is to oversee groups of people. They are the educators and guardians of the realm of earth. Like beings related to the world of the germinal ideas, they are said to inspire living things to many things such as art or science.[16][failed verification]

Paul used the term rule and authority in Ephesians 1:21,[17] and rulers and authorities in Ephesians 3:10.[18]
