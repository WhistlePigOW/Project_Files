Cherubim have four faces, one of a man, an ox, a lion, and an eagle (later adopted as the symbols of the four evangelists). They have four conjoined wings covered with eyes (although Revelation 4:8 appears to describe them with six wings like the seraphim), a lion's body, and the feet of oxen. Cherubim guard the way to the tree of life in the Garden of Eden[8] and the throne of God.[9]

The cherubim are mentioned in Genesis, Exodus, 2 Chronicles, Ezekiel and 1 Kings.[8][10][11]

St. Thomas Aquinas imagined Satan as a fallen Cherub.[12]
