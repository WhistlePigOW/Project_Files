Sariel (Aramaic: שריאל, Greek: Σαριηλ, Coptic: ⲥⲟⲩⲣⲓⲏⲗ[2][3] "Prince of God" "God's Prince") is an angel, mainly from Judaic tradition. Other possible versions of his name are Suriel, Suriyel (in some Dead Sea Scrolls translations), Seriel, Sauriel, Saraqael, Sarakiel, Suruel, Surufel, and Sourial.

In 1 Enoch, there is a fallen Watcher named Säraquyael (Amharic: ሰራቁያል) and Säräqael (Amharic: ሰረቃኤል) one of the seven holy angels who is "of eternity and trembling". In Kabbalistic lore, he is one of seven angels of the earth. Origen identified Sariel as one of seven angels who considered primordial powers by the Ophites.[4] In Gnosticism, Sariel is invoked for his protective powers. He is commemorated in the calendar of the Coptic Orthodox Church on 27 Tobi in Coptic calendar.
