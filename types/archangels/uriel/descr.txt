Uriel /ˈjʊəriəl/; or Auriel also Oriel (Hebrew: אוּרִיאֵל‎ ʾŪrīʾēl, "El/God is my light" or "Light of God"; Greek: Οὐριήλ Ouriìl; Coptic: ⲟⲩⲣⲓⲏⲗ Ouriyl;[5] Italian: Uriele;[6] Geʽez and Amharic: ዑራኤል ʿUraʾēl[7] or ዑርኤል ʿUriʾēl)[8] is the name of one of the archangels who is mentioned in the post-exilic rabbinic tradition and in certain Christian traditions. He is well known in the Russian Orthodox tradition (which considers him to be one of the seven major archangels) and recognized in the Anglican Church as the 4th archangel. He is also well known in European esoteric medieval literature. Uriel is also known as a master of knowledge and archangel of wisdom.

In apocryphal, kabbalistic, and occult works, Uriel/Auriel has been equated (or confused) with Urial,[9] Nuriel, Uryan, Jeremiel, Vretil, Sariel, Suriel, Puruel, Phanuel, Jacob, Azrael, and Raphael.

Uriel or Auriel (male) / Urielle or Eurielle (female) is also a name assimilated by the Celtic Brittanic culture, because of Saint Urielle [fr] (7th century), sister of the Breton king Saint Judicael, who popularised the name.
